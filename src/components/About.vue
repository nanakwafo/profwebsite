    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I am a <strong>results-driven Software Engineer</strong> with over <strong>8 years of industry experience</strong>, 
      specializing in <strong>DevOps</strong>, <strong>Site Reliability Engineering</strong>, and 
      <strong>full-stack web development</strong>. My core strengths lie in architecting <strong>secure, scalable cloud infrastructure</strong> 
      on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, with deep expertise in <strong>automation</strong>, 
      <em>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</em>, and compliance frameworks such as <strong>PCI DSS</strong> and <strong>SOC 2</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a solid foundation in <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong>, container orchestration (ECS, EKS, Docker), 
      and <strong>cloud security best practices</strong>, I build <strong>resilient systems</strong> that meet both agility and regulatory requirements. 
      I simplify operations through <strong>smart tooling</strong>, automation at scale, and <em>well-maintained documentation</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an <strong>AWS-certified engineer</strong> with a <strong>BSc in Computer Science and Engineering</strong>, 
      I bring hands-on experience as a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong> — delivering performant applications using <strong>Laravel</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong>. 
      This hybrid skill set enables me to bridge the gap between <strong>infrastructure and application development teams</strong> effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to <strong>large-scale delivery teams</strong>, implementing strategic initiatives, 
      resolving client-facing challenges, and driving value through <strong>continuous process improvement</strong> and <strong>automation</strong>.
