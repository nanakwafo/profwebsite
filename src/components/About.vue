    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a results-driven DevOps and Site Reliability Engineer with deep expertise in AWS infrastructure, security compliance (including PCI DSS and SOC 2), and automation at scale. I specialize in architecting and operating secure, scalable cloud systems, while reducing complexity through smart tooling, Infrastructure as Code, and thorough documentation.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
With a strong foundation in CI/CD, container orchestration (ECS/EKS/Docker), and cloud security best practices, I build resilient systems that align with both business agility and compliance mandates.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Additionally, I bring hands-on experience as a full-stack web developer, using Laravel and Vue.js to build intuitive, performant applications — allowing me to bridge the gap between infrastructure and application development teams.
